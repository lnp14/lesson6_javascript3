### Project Description:
In Assignment 6, we utilized JavaScript to complete a photo gallery application that allows the user to look through the images. JavaScript allows us to modify the page content through external events. The browser object model states the objects, properties and methods of the browser and the relationship that exists. The document object model was also used because it is a dynamic webpage and the changes occured in the Document object. We utilized the getElementbyId() method to add event listeners to the photo gallery. We also created local variables for different functions. Next, we changed the src attribute values of the img elements by utilizing the populateFigures() function, so navigation in the photo gallery would work. We then added a feature that allowed five images, instead of only three, to be on the screen in the photo gallery app by using the DOM method to create new nodes and add them to the DOM tree. We utilized the appendChild() method to add the img element as a child of the figure element to create a document fragment, which was then added to the DOM tree for the document. Lastly, we created a copy of the lastFigure node by using the cloneNode() method to to create the firstFigure node.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A lesson I learned in this assignment is what the Browser Object Model is. BOM is also known as client-side object model, which is based on the hierarchy of objects. In JavaScript, every element on a web page is an object. Each object provides programmatic access to a different aspect of the web page or browser.
2. A lesson I learned in this assignment is what the Document Object Model is. A document object represents the web page displayed in a browser, which contains all web page elements. Each element is represented by its own object in JavaScript and each item in the DOM tree is a node. DOMâ€™s structure consists of objects with a set of properties and methods listed underneath it. 
3. A lesson I learned in this assignment is that there are many methods for JavaScript to reference web page elements. If the getElementById() method is used, it will return the first element in a document with a matching id  attribute. If the getElementByTagName() method is, it will return an array of elements that match the specified tag name. If the getElementByClassName() (or the getElementByName()) method is used, it will return a node list or HTML collection of elements with a class (name) attribute that matches a specified value.
